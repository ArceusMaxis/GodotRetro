## About

**Godot Retro** is a collection of shaders for godot, with various ports of shaders from *ShaderToy*, *Unity* and The *Book Of Shaders*. 



## License

* Shaders

All shaders are licensed under **CC0**, with the exception of the *Glitch* and the *NTSC Basic* shaders, which are licensed under **MIT**. 

* Example Scenes

*Models*, *scripts*, *textures* and *sounds* are all under **CC0**.

The *shrWind* shader, used in map 4, was made by **Maujoe** and licensed under **MIT**.

### Recommendation

The shaders look their best when they are used together!

**Example :**

This scene uses the following combination : **Lens Distortion + Grain + TV**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56614267/138868860-0a105613-279c-4918-84b1-a1208ad206f8.png" width="50%"></img>

And this scene uses this combination : **Lens Distortion + Sharpness + NTSC**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56614267/138868037-8d0ec41a-9e59-47ec-9873-fc9a2ff014b9.gif" width="50%"></img>


- Tip 1 : **Sharpness** is a must have when using any of the *TV*, *VHS* or the *NTSC* shaders for getting a more realistic retro effect!

- Tip 2 : **Lens Distortion** and a high FOV looks like the old MTV 2000 blumbers aesthetics if used correctly!

- Tip 3 : Be careful with **Grain**! It can get very messy if you aren't careful!

- Tip 4 : All shaders can be used beyond their default range values, just open the shader code and adjust the numbers inside the *hint_range()* function in the variables section.

- Tip 5 : **ALWAYS** check the headers of the shaders you are using, there's information about the *compatibility*, *credits* and *licensing*!



## Installation

**How to use a shader included in this collection in your projects** :

1. Copy the *GodotRetro* folder to your project (can be added anywhere in the filesystem)


***For normal shader*** :

2. Just add the shader to a *ShaderMaterial*.


***For screen space shaders*** :

2. Create a *ColorRect* and make it a *FullRect* in the *Layout* options

3. Assign the preferred shader to the *ShaderMaterial* property of the *ColorRect*.


**Example :**

**You have successfully applied your first shader!!** Have fun!


### DISCLAMER :

- To use 2 or more shaders at the same time, you gotta use a BackBufferCopy set as Viewport for each shader.
- 
- For UI, make sure to set it above the shaders for them to be affected by the shaders for more uniformity and immersion.



## Examples

5 free and easy to learn example scenes are included in this collection.

## Features

 - **22** easy to use godot shaders

 - 5 well done **example projects**



## Limitations

Unfortunately, some shaders arent 100% perfect.

 - Some shaders may not work in GLES2, please check the respective shader's header inside the shader code tab for more information!
